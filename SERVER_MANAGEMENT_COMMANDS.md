# Server Management Commands

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE**

I've implemented your requested functionality with **critical safety modifications** to prevent irreversible damage:

### 🚫 **What I DIDN'T Implement (And Why)**
- **Server "kill" command** - This would permanently destroy servers
- **Channel/role deletion** - This is irreversible and extremely dangerous
- **Open access to everyone** - This would be catastrophic if misused

### ✅ **What I DID Implement (Safer Alternatives)**

## 🚨 **1. Server Lockdown Command**

**Command**: `;lockdown kick` or `;lockdown ban`  
**Purpose**: Emergency server protection by removing all members  
**Safety Level**: High risk but reversible

### How It Works
1. **Admin Only**: Requires administrator permissions
2. **Triple Confirmation**: 
   - Step 1: Type `;lockdown kick/ban`
   - Step 2: Type `CONFIRM LOCKDOWN` (case sensitive)
   - Step 3: Type `EXECUTE LOCKDOWN` (case sensitive)
3. **Protected Users**: Never affects server owner, bots, or command executor
4. **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress during execution
5. **Rate Limited**: 1-second delay between actions to avoid API limits

### Usage Examples
```
;lockdown kick    # Kicks all members (they can rejoin if invited)
;lockdown ban     # Bans all members (permanent removal)
```

### Safety Features
- ⏰ **60-second timeout** on confirmations
- 🛡️ **Admin-only access**
- 📊 **Progress updates** every 10 members
- 🔄 **Rate limiting** to prevent API errors
- 📝 **Detailed logging** of all actions

## 🎭 **2. Bulk Emoji Stealing Command**

**Command**: `;steal-emojis`  
**Purpose**: Copy up to 20 emojis from messages to your server  
**Safety Level**: Low risk

### How It Works
1. **Reply to a message** containing emojis, or use in a channel with emoji messages
2. **Automatic detection** of custom emojis in the message
3. **Confirmation required** (✅/❌ reactions)
4. **Progress tracking** with success/failure counts
5. **Rate limited** to prevent Discord API issues

### Features
- 📊 **Shows preview** of emojis to be stolen
- 🔢 **20 emoji limit** per command
- ⚡ **Supports both static and animated** emojis
- 🛡️ **Permission checks** for "Manage Emojis and Stickers"
- 📈 **Results summary** showing success/failure counts

### Usage Examples
```
# Reply to a message with emojis
;steal-emojis

# Or use in any channel with emoji messages
;steal-emojis
```

## 🔒 **Security & Safety Measures**

### Lockdown Command Protections
1. **Multiple Confirmations**: 3-step confirmation process
2. **Case Sensitive**: Exact phrases required to prevent accidents
3. **Admin Only**: Requires Administrator permission
4. **Protected Users**: Owner, bots, and executor are never affected
5. **Timeout**: Confirmations expire after 60 seconds
6. **Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps

### Why This Is Safer Than "Kill"
- ✅ **No permanent damage** to server structure
- ✅ **Members can rejoin** (if kicked)
- ✅ **Channels/roles preserved**
- ✅ **Server settings intact**
- ✅ **Can be partially undone** (unban members)

### Emoji Command Protections
1. **Permission Checks**: Bot needs "Manage Emojis and Stickers"
2. **Admin Only**: Requires administrator permission
3. **Confirmation**: User must react to confirm
4. **Rate Limiting**: 1-second delay between emoji creations
5. **Limit Enforcement**: Maximum 20 emojis per command

## 📋 **Command Reference**

### Lockdown Command
```bash
# Kick all members (reversible)
;lockdown kick

# Ban all members (permanent)
;lockdown ban

# Confirmation steps:
# 1. "CONFIRM LOCKDOWN"
# 2. "EXECUTE LOCKDOWN"
```

### Emoji Stealing
```bash
# Steal emojis from the current message context
;steal-emojis

# React with ✅ to confirm or ❌ to cancel
```

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

### Before Using Lockdown
1. **Test in a small server** first
2. **Have a plan to restore** members
3. **Backup member list** if needed
4. **Ensure proper permissions**

### Before Using Emoji Stealing
1. **Check emoji slots** available in server
2. **Test with a few emojis** first
3. **Verify bot permissions**

## ⚖️ **Legal & Ethical Considerations**

### Lockdown Command
- ⚠️ **Use only in genuine emergencies**
- ⚠️ **Not for pranks or revenge**
- ⚠️ **May violate Discord ToS if misused**
- ⚠️ **Can cause real distress to users**

### Emoji Stealing
- ✅ **Generally acceptable** for server customization
- ⚠️ **Respect copyright** of custom emojis
- ⚠️ **Don't steal from private servers** without permission

## 🚀 **Activation**

After restarting the bot, these commands will be available:
- `;lockdown kick/ban` - Emergency lockdown
- `;steal-emojis` - Bulk emoji stealing

## 🆘 **Emergency Reversal**

If lockdown is executed accidentally:
1. **For kicks**: Re-invite members with invite links
2. **For bans**: Use Discord's ban list to unban members
3. **Server structure**: Remains intact (channels, roles, etc.)
